Durbin's Algorithm Implementation
--------------------------------------------------------
- Open the code in Visual Studio 2010.
- Compile and Run to see the output of text file test.txt placed in same folder as source code file.
- For custom code run/input, the variables at the beginning of the main() function need to be set accordingly.
- To run the code on some other test file, "dir" has to be set to the directory containing the file, and "fileName" has to be set to the complete name of file.
- To apply hamming window to the input, "applyWindow" has to be set to true.
- "N" is the number of samples in the first frame that have to be analyzed by the code, and "p" is the number of past samples to be used in LPC.
- "isHeader" has to be set to true if the input contains default CoolEdit header.
